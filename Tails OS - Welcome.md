    | Downloading files and software from the internet is a necessary part of modern life.    |
    | However, it's not without risk - especially when those files or software come from      |
    | untrusted sources. Verifying the integrity of your downloads is the first line of       |
    | defense between yourself and a really bad day.                                          |
    |                                                                                         |
    | - Preventing Malware Infections: The cyber STD                                          |
    | Downloads from untrusted sources have a higher likelihood of containing malicious       |
    | payloads - Viruses, Trojans, ransomware, and other nasty goodies. Verifying your        |
    | downloaded content helps to ensure you're not signing up for a "free trial" to something|
    | you didn't ask for, like a remote access Trojan.                                        |
    |                                                                                         |
    | - Data Corruption: Not all downloads are created equal                                  |
    | Sometimes files go rogue. It's not a conspiracy, it's just the reality of how data moves|
    | through networks. Whether it's due to a botched download, garbage internet connection   |
    | or even just some good ol' fashion bad luck, data corruption happens. If you're         |
    | downloading a file and it gets corrupted half way through, chances are high you're not  |
    | going to get very far post download. Verifying the file's hash against the developer's  |
    | original ensures that the file is intact and good to go.                                |
    |                                                                                         |
    | - Ensuring Software Authenticity: <img src="3-way-spiderman-pointing">                  |
    | If you've ever fallen for the allure of free software that's just too good to pass up,  |
    | you're not alone (Que the wild west days of limewire). But when it comes to downloading |
    | software from untrusted sources, buyer beware. Files from unofficial or unverified      |
    | websites can easily be altered to include malicious tid bits, without any visible       |
    | signs of tampering. The file may look legitimate, but it could easily be hiding some    |
    | of those cyber STDs I mentioned above... gross.                                         |

    | The Tails OS USB is a bootable media device (plug and play right out of the box).       |
    | This limits me being able to add the actual verification files directly to the USB for  |
    | user verification. A certain level of inherited trust needs to be established that I    |
    | didn't H4x0r pwn the shit out of these bad boys, and no amount of file verification     |
    | is going to provide you with that 100% confidence. Given this constraint, the primary   |
    | avenue for building trust is the external documentation found on this GitHub page,      |
    | transparency of security limitations, and my reputation.                                |
