    | Warning - Incoming mini cybersecurity lecture                                           |
    |                                                                                         |
    | Downloading files and software from the internet is a necessary part of modern life.    |
    | However, it's not without risk - especially when those files come from untrusted        |
    | sources. Verifying the integrity of your downloads is the first line of defense between |
    | yourself and a really bad day.                                                          |
    |                                                                                         |
    | - Preventing Malware Infections: The cyber STD                                          |
    | Files obtained from shady sources (like Defcon) can easily contain malicious payloads,  |
    | viruses, trojans, ransomware, or other nasty little surprises. Verifying your files     |
    | helps to ensure you're not unintentially signing up for a "free trial" to something     |
    | you didn't ask for - like a remote access Trojan.                                       |
    |                                                                                         |
    | - Data Corruption: Not all downloads are created equal                                  |
    | Sometimes files go rogue. It's not a conspiracy, it's just the reality of how data moves|
    | across networks. Maybe your connection drops, maybe the datas borked from the get go,   |
    | or just maybe, some of those downloaded bits didnt byte right. Whatever the reason,     |
    | corrupted downloads happen. Verifying the file's hash against the developer's original  |
    | helps ensures your file is intact and usable.                                           |
    |                                                                                         |
    | - Ensuring Software Authenticity: <img src="3-way-spiderman-pointing">                  |
    | Tempted by free software that seems too good to be true? We've all been there (Que the  |
    | wild west days of limewire). But files from unofficial or unverified sources can easily |
    | be altered to include malicous extras. The file might look legitimate, but it could be  |
    | hiding one of that cyber STDs I mentioned earlier.... And that's not fun for anyone     |

    | The Tails OS USB is a bootable media device (plug and play out of the box).             |
    | This limits me being able to add the actual verification files directly to the USB for  |
    | user verification. A certain level of inherited trust needs to be established that I    |
    | didn't H4x0r pwn the shit out of these bad boys, and no amount of file verification     |
    | is going to provide you with that 100% confidence. Given this constraint, the primary   |
    | avenue for building trust is the external documentation found on this GitHub page,      |
    | transparency of security limitations, and my reputation - You trust me... right? RIGHT? |
